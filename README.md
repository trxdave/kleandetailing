Klean detailing involves the thorough cleaning and restoration of a vehicle, both inside and out. Car detailers use various cleaning products, tools, and techniques to enhance a vehicle's appearance and condition. Their services range from basic washes to intensive cleaning jobs. Detailers clean automotive interiors, addressing aspects like upholstery, dashboard, and windows, as well as exteriors, focusing on paintwork, wheels, and other exterior components. They may also apply protective measures like waxing and sealing on the vehicle's exterior to maintain its shine and protect it from environmental elements.

## Polishing: 
Polishing in car detailing is a process that involves the use of specialized compounds and abrasive pads to remove minor imperfections from a vehicle's paint surface. It aims to restore and enhance the paint's gloss by eliminating swirl marks, light scratches, and oxidation. The technique results in a smoother and shinier finish.

## Paint Correction: 
Paint correction is a more advanced and comprehensive process focused on restoring the integrity of a vehicle's paintwork. It addresses moderate to severe imperfections such as deeper scratches, heavy swirl marks, and other defects. This multi-stage process typically uses various grades of abrasive compounds and polishing techniques to achieve a flawless, defect-free finish.

Both polishing and paint correction contribute to enhancing the aesthetic appearance of a vehicle's paint, providing a more vibrant and polished look. These processes are often part of professional car detailing services.
